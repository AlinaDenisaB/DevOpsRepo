<p><h2>Welcome to my online store application!

	This is the home page &#128522;

<p> &#x1F31F;  For the moment, the online store application allows to the admin to add new categories or products, to update the price of the products and to delete existing products from the database. All the changes are visible in the products page.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p> &#x1F31F;  The idea behind the online store is to promote unique design products, such as T-shirts, hoodies, notebooks or mugs, inspirated by Portuguese old sayings about life, viewed from the designer's perspective, but also eco-friendly products to minimize waste in our personal lives, such as toothbrushes made of bamboo, all of them achieving a great impact in the world.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p> &#x1F31F;  As future improvements, the application will allow to the customer to add products to the cart, to remove products from the cart, to change the quantity and to do the payments, so their order can be delivered. And because the customers' opinion matters, a new page will be dedicated for reviews, so the business can change permanently in order to satisfy the custumers' needs.</p>
