## ***Introduction*** ##  
  #### About application: ####
 * For now, the online store application allows to the admin to add new categories or products, to update the price of the products and to delete existing products from the database. All the changes are visible in the products page.  
 * The idea behind the online store is to promote unique design products, such as T-shirts, hoodies, notebooks or mugs, inspirated by Portuguese old sayings about life, viewed from the designer's perspective, but also eco-friendly products to minimize waste in our personal lives, such as toothbrushes made of bamboo, all of them achieving a great impact in the world.
  
  #### User Stories: ####  
 * As a vendor, I want to publish my products online, so that I can make it accessible for anyone and increase my business.  
 * As an online shopping customer, I want to be able to access the website, so that I can find out more details about the products.  
 * As an online shopping customer, I want to create an account, so that I can be able to order my favorite products at home.

## Future improvements ##
  * As future improvements, the application will allow to the customer to add products to the cart, to remove products from the cart, to change the quantity and to do the payments, so their order can be delivered. And because the customers' opinion matters, a new page will be dedicated for reviews, so the business can change permanently in order to satisfy the custumers' needs.
